# Numerical Methods: Julia VS MATLAB

The goal of this site is to explain various different mathematical algorithms (**numerical methods**) that one might encounter in a typical undergraduate course in Numerical Methods. However, all algorithms on this site will have two implementations - one in MATLAB and one in Julia

MATLAB is the programming language that my university used to teach Numerical Methods, and it's a common language to use at many universities for teaching this course. It is also widely used for mathematical programming and modelling in academia and in industry. 

I stumbled across Julia while taking this course myself as an undergraduate. Julia was developed by computer scientists at MIT, and it boasts incredibly powerful and fast scientific computing that is more accesible to mathematicians. 

The purpose of this site therefore is not so much to teach numerical methods (although you will get a high-level overview of them here), but rather to show off the differences between Julia and MATLAB - and more importantly why Julia is a far superior programming language to MATLAB. For each algorithm, I'll be running benchmark tests between the languages to show the differences in the languages, and hopefully encourage more universities to start teaching this course using Julia rather than MATLAB.
